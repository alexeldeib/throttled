# throttled

Simple IOPS and throughput monitoring for Azure VMs. Discovers all disk
and machine limits through instance metadata and exposes current
utilization as a percentage of total uncached limits. Note that ratios
may be greater than 1 with caching enabled, and may briefly peak above 1
before encountering throttling.

## Log output

The daemon logs json at startup containing the vm and sku limits for
each detected disk.

## Prometheus metrics

Note that iops and bandwidth as raw numbers are available through many
sources, they are here only as a sanity check against the ratios since
they need to be collected anyway for calculation. It's possible to only
expose the limits as fully static metrics to optimize resource usage
(not currently implemented).

In this example, a workload (fio) issues many small writes to the
temporary disk of the VM. We see 8268 IOPS against /dev/sdb (the
temporary disk), and a few IOPS against the /dev/sda, OS disk.

The VM SKU is a Standard_D8s_v3 which has 12k uncache IOPS and 16k
cached IOPS. We see it's at about 64% of its uncached limit.

```

In the next example, the VM is at its uncached limits and aggressively
uses the Azure disk caching layer to achieve the cached throughput
rates, typically about 20-25% higher than the uncached limits. Notice
iops_ratio{device="TOTAL"} is greater than 1.0. In fact, it's about 25%
greater because the VM is at the cached limit (which is typically a hard
cap).

iops{device="/dev/loop0"} 0
iops{device="/dev/sda"} 0

throughput_ratio{device="/dev/sdc"} 0
throughput_ratio{device="/dev/sdd"} 0
throughput_ratio{device="TOTAL"} 0.000325
```

In this last example, we see the OS disk burst above its sku limits to
~320% of its limit to saturate the VM limit. The VM limit in this case
is 16k IOPS on a Standard_D8s_v3 while the disk limit is 5k IOPS for a P30.

## what it does

The daemon uses IMDS to identify the VM size, OS disk size, and OS disk
storage type. IMDS also provides the size, LUN, and storage types for
all data disks. The SKUs API provides all virtual machine and
disk SKUs with cabilities such as IOPS/bandwidth. Currently, we require
MSI on the VM to authenticate to the SKUs API.

By joining IMDS and SKU data on VM size and storage type, we can
identify VM-level IOPS and bandwidth limits.

By joining IMDS and SKU data on disk size and storage type, we can
identify disk-level IOPS and bandwidth limits.

We use the LUNs from data disks to map to friendly udev labels like /dev/sdX.
This is preferable for metrics capture.

We assume /dev/sda and /dev/sdb are always the OS disk and temporary
disk for linux VMs. This is used only in its absence: We assume iostat
will collect this device and don't manually try to map it using udev rules.

After discovering all limits, the daemon polls iostat (or any similar
method) periodically. It exposes a metrics endpoint Prometheus-style
with the hostname and device name, along with a gauge equal to the
percent of IOPS or bandwidth limit. We use friendly udev labels mapped
from LUNs to attach to each metric.
